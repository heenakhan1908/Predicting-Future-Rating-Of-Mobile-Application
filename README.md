# Predicting-Future-Rating-Of-Mobile-Application

Though the future of new app development is not yet certain, we had looked to the past for reference and predict what’s yet to come. It’s a good bet that in the future the field will be heavily saturated with data points and API connections — and this says nothing of app development.

Naive Bayes classification is used in this project to predict the rating. The rest of the model attempted was to build a model which would classify an application as successful or not based on its description. A naive based classifier text was chosen, and the implementation was done in Python.
